title: "Photography"

Due to the impact of COVID-19 and my research activities for my Master's degree, I am trying to participate in the bicycle long-distance event Brevet, which has been on hiatus since 2016; I aim to complete 200 km, 300 km, 400 km and 600 km in order to be able to participate in PBP 2027. Through self-portraits I capture the essence of my own being and reflect on my own journey through time. Each photograph is a reflection of my own experiences and emotions. Through these photos I hope to offer a glimpse into my life as a learner and explorer, and to inspire others to reflect on their own round-the-world journeys.
