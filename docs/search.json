    "text": "Due to the impact of COVID-19 and my research activities for my Master’s degree, I am trying to participate in the bicycle long-distance event Brevet, which has been on hiatus since 2016; I aim to complete 200 km, 300 km, 400 km and 600 km in order to be able to participate in PBP 2027. Through self-portraits I capture the essence of my own being and reflect on my own journey through time. Each photograph is a reflection of my own experiences and emotions. Through these photos I hope to offer a glimpse into my life as a learner and explorer, and to inspire others to reflect on their own round-the-world journeys.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n\n\n\n\nView the tutorial for this template (+ download link)"

My goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the cultures and histories of these peoples by studying their languages. Currently, I am working on a monograph that explores the linguistic roots of the Elvish languages. Through extensive research and analysis, I hope to shed light on the connections between the different dialects of Elvish and their origins. This project has been particularly challenging, as Elvish is a complex and nuanced language, but I am determined to see it through to completion."

By gathering information from a variety of sources, including my own memories, written accounts, and oral histories, I hope to shed new light on this important period in Middle-earth’s history and provide valuable insights into the motivations and actions of the various players involved.\n\nView the tutorial for this template (+ download link)"

I am currently looking for a place on a PhD programme and would like to continue my research. I use the R language for research analysis, but I am still a beginner.\nMy master’s thesis can be found in the following repository: My Master’s Thesis\nI would like to express my gratitude to Marvin Schmitt and his template below for his kindness in making this template available to me. Marvin Schmitt contact me if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects.\n\nView the tutorial for this template (+ download link)"
